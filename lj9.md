#entry 9 (November 5th)

I am feeling excited about the final project and also very tired and overwhelmed by the amount of time we'll have. It also feels like I am forgetting something and getting way behind on my submissions.

At the same time, I am trying to do some weekend-y stuff with my family and there is just not enough time for everything. Honestly, have no idea what to write about tonight. I am sure I've learned a ton this week, but it's not very clear what it was.

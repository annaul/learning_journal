#entry 6 (October 31st)

Worked on BusMall javascript and got some stuff done, but things kept breaking for reasons I couldn't pinpoint myself. It felt ok, though. I probably need to work on console-logging better and using debugger.

I am also glad that 6 o'clock comes very very quickly, my day is not dragging on and on. This may even mean I am having fun (Oh, no!). I do get upset when things don't work out and that is what makes me tired at the end of the day, I think.

#Entry 4 (October 26)

Today was the second time we worked in pairs and I am glad it went much better this time. We were stuck often, had to ask for help, but the work is done and it's not the worst quality! I am not even going to think about how many hours it took...

Yesterday I reworked code for resubmission on the last group work and it it actually felt good to make it better, so even if I don't get full points on this one, it is going to be fine.

This morning, for some reason, I kept thinking about the css side of cookie shop site. I want to use poster style, hopefully I can do it and not kill a day on it.

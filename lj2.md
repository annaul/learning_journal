#Entry 2 (October 19th)

I am still figuring out git and GitHub, it's more of an issue of being afraid than really not knowing stuff. Getting better, though. I am writing this in atom in .md right now to practice submitting it through terminal. All I know about this format at this point is that "#" is good for headings. Will figure out more as I go. This is what I like about this program (or, sometimes, hate) is there is a lot of "jumping right in" and doing things the way they are done "in real life".

TED talk was a nice change of pace today, enjoyed how it added variety to my day :).

About me website is a pain, I don't like writing resume type of stuff (I guess it is directly related to the TED talk) and it looks like "coming soon" is not going to cut it.

Skipped out on readings last night and got 8 hours of sleep instead, feel like I am really far behind now. I am o with the readings' content, but simply submitting so much all at once is stressful.

#Entry 4 (October 24th)

Yesterday was Sunday and I was happy to be all caught up with my assignments, today I found out a bunch of them need to be resubmitted and there is so much new stuff to do as well! I am a little overwhelmed. However, I am starting to recognize a pattern in my reaction to this program: first I fear, then I think that I know nothing, then I start little by little, I fail badly a few times and then... I decide to just get rid of nonsense, put my head down and figure it out. It's such a painful process, but I have to go through it again and again.

It sucks to be home and try and solve things, remote help is not the same. I don't remember having any confusion with objects in CodeCademy and DOM manipulation sounds like something that is going to take us away from those hideous popups. So, yay to week two!

#entry 8 (November 2)

It's entry 8 and I still don't know any other ways to style .md files other than what I have in the title line.

In the last couple of days I've tried not being afraid (or lazy) to rework things from the ground up and it definitely feels good to have cleaner looking code that (nice bonus) works. I also understand things better when I use my own logic from the beginning and don't try to figure out someone else's. This kind of approach may not be good for the real world, though.

Don't think there has been a single thing I've done this week that I can say was 100% my own work and sometimes I think of it like maybe it doesn't count because of all the help I am getting. Starting to realize that this is just how things are going to be for a while and I need to learn to be ok with it.

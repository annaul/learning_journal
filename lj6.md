#Entry 6 (October 28th)

Today was fun. Having to submit before 4:59pm was, at the same, time scary and very exciting. I think I am starting to worry a bit less, but I also getting more tired and maybe care less. 

Eventlisteners and forms were tough, but, according to today's speaker, in 7 days I'll understand. 

Seriously tired, have been working as a cuddle machine (my baby is sick) since I got home today.

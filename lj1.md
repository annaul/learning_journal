Entry 1 (October 17th)

We've gone over some material learned in CodeCademy plus some git stuff. At times it was hard to keep up, but I think the day went ok averall. 

When we got to our first coding assignment I felt like I don't know anything, for a minute, but then was able to whip up a simple program - nothing exciting, but I did it. Yay!

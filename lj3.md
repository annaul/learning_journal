#Entry 2 (October 21)

It was a long day today. I am feeling tired, but satisfied my work on the problems. Of course, it took way longer
than it probably should and I got stuck on silly things so many times, but it's done! Functions have been fun.

Going to work on CSS a bit more this weekend, hopefully that turns out ok. I really don't want to get myself too deep into the ugliness, but if I try to do something fancy with the code, it probably won't be pretty.

It was good to get some exposure to a different teaching style with Sam this morning, it seems like he went slower, or maybe he just had to because of the server attack :).
